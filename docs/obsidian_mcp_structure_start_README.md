You're absolutely right - I was getting ahead of myself with those specialized workflows. Let's step back and think about the fundamental building blocks that would make a solid foundation for an Obsidian MCP server. The beauty of starting with basics is that they can be composed into more complex operations later.

## The Core Tool Set: Essential Operations

When we look at what Obsidian fundamentally is - a markdown file manager with linking capabilities - we can identify the truly essential operations. These should map relatively closely to the REST API while still following MCP's principle of clear, intent-based naming.

**Note Management Tools** form the foundation. You'd want `read_note` to get the content of a specific note, `create_note` to make new notes with proper frontmatter support, `update_note` to modify existing content, and `delete_note` for removal. These are your basic CRUD operations, but with Obsidian-aware features like automatic link updating when files move.

The key insight here is that even these "basic" tools should understand Obsidian's conventions. For instance, `create_note` should handle the vault's folder structure intelligently, support frontmatter for metadata, and understand special note types like daily notes. But it shouldn't try to guess what kind of note you're creating - that's the user's decision.

**Search and Discovery Tools** would include `search_notes` for text and tag-based searching, `get_backlinks` to find what links to a specific note, and `list_notes` to browse the vault structure. These tools expose Obsidian's organizational features without imposing any particular workflow. The search tool should support Obsidian's search syntax, but in a way that's accessible to AI systems.

**Organization Tools** might include `move_note` to relocate files while maintaining links, `add_tags` and `remove_tags` for metadata management, and perhaps `get_note_info` to retrieve metadata without the full content. These tools handle the "housekeeping" aspects of knowledge management.

## Resource Pattern: Direct Access to Vault Structure

For resources, the pattern should mirror how files are actually organized in the vault, making it predictable and easy to understand. Think of resources as providing "read-only windows" into your vault.

The most straightforward pattern would be `vault://{path}` where the path directly corresponds to the file structure. So `vault://Daily Notes/2024-01-15.md` would return that specific daily note's content. This direct mapping makes it immediately clear what you're accessing.

For collections, you might have `vault://folder/{path}` to list contents of a directory, and `vault://tag/{tagname}` to get all notes with a specific tag. These resources return lists of notes rather than content, providing navigation capabilities.

## Prompt Templates: Basic Knowledge Operations

Even for basic operations, a few well-designed prompt templates can significantly improve usability. These should focus on common, fundamental tasks rather than complex workflows.

A **Quick Capture** template might simply take a thought and figure out where to put it based on content, but without being overly clever about it. A **Find Related Notes** template could help discover connections to a topic without assuming any particular research methodology. A **Daily Review** template might list recent notes and suggest basic organization tasks.

The key is that these templates use the basic tools in straightforward ways, demonstrating patterns that users can build upon rather than trying to encode complex workflows.

## Why This Approach Works Better

Starting with basics has several advantages. First, it creates a stable foundation - these core operations are unlikely to change regardless of how Obsidian evolves. Second, it's easier to test and debug when each tool has a clear, single purpose. Third, users can understand what each tool does without extensive documentation.

Most importantly, this approach respects both Obsidian's philosophy and MCP's design principles. Obsidian users value flexibility and personal workflows, so providing basic building blocks rather than prescriptive tools aligns with their expectations. Meanwhile, MCP benefits from clear, focused tools that AI systems can reason about easily.

Think of it like providing a well-organized toolbox rather than pre-built furniture. Users (and AI agents) can combine these basic tools in countless ways to support their unique knowledge management approaches. A simple `create_note` combined with `add_tags` and `get_backlinks` can support everything from Zettelkasten to PARA to completely custom organizational systems.

## Moving Forward

Once you have these basics working solidly, you can always add more sophisticated tools based on actual usage patterns. Maybe you'll find that users frequently combine certain operations, suggesting a higher-level tool would be valuable. Or perhaps certain prompt templates become popular, indicating workflows worth supporting more directly.

The beauty of starting simple is that you're building on solid ground. Each basic tool can be thoroughly tested and optimized, creating a reliable foundation for whatever comes next. And users can start getting value immediately, even as you continue to enhance the system.
