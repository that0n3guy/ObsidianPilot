# ObsidianPilot v2.1.3 Release Notes

## üêõ Critical Bug Fix: Boolean Search with Multi-word Terms

### Overview
Version 2.1.3 fixes a critical bug in FTS5 boolean search where queries combining multi-word terms with OR operators would return zero results.

### üéØ Issue Fixed
- **‚ùå Boolean OR with multi-word terms failed**: Queries like `Ahmed EL-Emawy OR "Medical Resource Staffing"` returned 0 results
- **‚úÖ Now working**: Same query now returns all expected results from both terms

### üîç Root Cause
The FTS5 query transformation logic incorrectly converted boolean queries containing multi-word terms into phrase searches, breaking the boolean operators.

**Before (Broken)**:
- Input: `Ahmed EL-Emawy OR "Medical Resource Staffing"`
- Transformed: `"Ahmed EL-Emawy OR Medical Resource Staffing"` (entire query as phrase)
- Result: 0 results (searching for the entire string as one phrase)

**After (Fixed)**:
- Input: `Ahmed EL-Emawy OR "Medical Resource Staffing"`  
- Transformed: `"Ahmed EL-Emawy" OR "Medical Resource Staffing"` (proper boolean)
- Result: All results containing either term

### üîß Technical Details

#### Enhanced Query Transformation
- Added `_quote_multiword_terms()` method to properly handle multi-word terms in boolean queries
- Improved boolean operator detection to handle complex queries
- Multi-word terms are now automatically quoted when used with boolean operators

#### Examples of Fixed Queries
```
‚úÖ Ahmed EL-Emawy OR "Medical Resource Staffing" 
‚úÖ John Smith AND "Project Management"
‚úÖ "Data Science" OR machine learning
‚úÖ Peter Olson AND Tyler Chowdhry
```

### üöÄ Impact
This fix enables complex searches that were previously impossible:
- Searching for multiple people with multi-word names
- Combining company names with individual terms
- Complex boolean queries mixing quoted phrases and multi-word terms

### Backward Compatibility
- No breaking changes
- All existing queries continue to work as before
- Simple searches and single boolean operators unaffected
